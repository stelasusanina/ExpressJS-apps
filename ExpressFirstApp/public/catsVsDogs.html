      <h2>Debate</h2>
      <p>
        It’s on: the ultimate pet showdown, a battle between dogs and cats.
        Sure, they’re both adorable. Yes, they’re both cuddly. But which one
        makes the best pet? Are dogs really top dog? Are cats really, er, the
        cat’s meow?

      <h2>Puppy Love</h2>
      <p>
        More than half of American families have one or the other, but dogs win
        when it comes to popularity. Dog freaks outnumber cat fans by almost
        two-to-one. All this doggy devotion may have something to do with dogs’
        big brainpower. “The average dog can learn 165 words; that’s equivalent
        to the vocabulary of a 2-year-old child,” says Stanley Coren, an
        animal-behavior expert, in Parade magazine. Dog lovers say this makes
        canines especially aware of what’s going on in the human world. Feline
        vocabularies can’t compete—cats can learn about 35 words. Another reason
        to love dogs? They work hard. Dogs have helped people herd cows and
        sheep for ages, but now these four-legged friends do more than ever.
        They guide the blind, hunt criminals, detect termites and gas leaks, and
        can even smell cancer in medical patients. Cats are good hunters, but
        they are way less energetic. In fact, the average house cat spends 80
        percent of the day lounging and sleeping.

      <h2>Purrfect Pals</h2>
      <p>
        For such snoozy animals, cats are surprisingly independent creatures.
        Most dogs rely on humans for food, exercise, bathing, and constant
        affection. Put out food and a litter box, and most cats are happy just
        to hang out. Not to mention, kitties are a real bargain. Including food,
        toys, and vet visits over a lifetime, the cost of caring for a cat is
        about one sixth of usual dog expenses. And when cats do get moving,
        these little acrobats are amazingly agile. “Cats are very nimble, with
        great balance,” says veterinarian Michael Garvey in Parade. “I’ve seen
        cats that have fallen more than 32 stories and didn’t have serious
        fractures.” It’s part of why cats are said to have nine lives. (They
        typically live about three or four years longer than dogs.)
